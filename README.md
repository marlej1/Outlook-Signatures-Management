# Outlook-Signatures-Management

My biggest prject so far.

ASP.NET MVC application with JQuery, Ajax, Bootstrap and Entity Framework.

Application is a tool for managing singatures in a company.  It implements CRUD operations for Employee, Signature and Campaign models.
You can create your own signature or a campaign with an embedded HTML editor. 

A signature can be set to a default for the whole organization. There can only be one default singature for all employeess at the same time. 
You can also assing the  sginature from the level of a single employee. Second option overrides the default implemntation.

There is also a preview option where a user can see how the craeted signature would look like when filled the data of the employee selected
froma a dropdown list. To the singature a user can add some fields like first name, last name, email address. After going to preview mode those
fields are replaced with the data of the selectend employee.

Campaigns can have their lifetime. All campaigns that are currently running are visble then in the preview mode
underneath the selected signature.
